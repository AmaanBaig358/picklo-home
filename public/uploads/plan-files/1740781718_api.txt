2. Test the createPayment API:
Once your application is set up and the PayPal credentials are configured, you can test the createPayment function:

Start your app: Make sure your Laravel app is running (php artisan serve or similar).

Test the Endpoint:

Use a REST client like Postman or Insomnia to send a POST request to the createPayment endpoint.
URL: http://localhost:8000/api/paypal/create-payment
Body (JSON):
json
Copy
{
  "package_id": 1
}
Replace 1 with an actual package_id that exists in your user_packages table.
Expected Response: If the package ID exists and the request is successful, you should receive a response like this:

json
Copy
{
  "status": "success",
  "redirect_url": "https://www.paypal.com/checkoutnow?token=xxxxxxxxxx"
}
The redirect_url will be a PayPal checkout URL where you can proceed with the payment.

3. Test the PayPal Checkout:
Copy the redirect_url from the response and open it in your browser.
Complete the payment process using the PayPal sandbox account.
4. Test the capturePayment API:
After the payment is made, PayPal will redirect to your capture payment endpoint. Here's how to test it:

Test the Endpoint:

Once you've completed the payment process on PayPal, PayPal will redirect to your capturePayment endpoint with a token parameter in the URL, like so:
bash
Copy
http://localhost:8000/api/paypal/capture-payment?token=xxxxxxxxxx
Use a tool like Postman or Insomnia to send a POST request to capture-payment, including the token and package ID:
URL: http://localhost:8000/api/paypal/capture-payment
Body (JSON):
json
Copy
{
  "token": "xxxxxxxxxx",
  "package_id": 1
}
Expected Response: If the payment was successful and the package ID exists, you should receive a response like this:

json
Copy
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Payment completed successfully."
}
If there was an issue with the payment, the response would indicate an error, like:

json
Copy
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Payment failed or was not completed. Please try again."
}
